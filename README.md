# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
To perform exploratory ananlysis and create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
## Results:
-In rural cities , total rides are far less than other cities, there are few drivers and so the total amount of fare is also less.The average fare per driver is high than any       other city although average per ride is less which shows that some rural cities have high demand for servive and low availabilty of drivers.

-In Suburban cities are at medium scale in terms of number of rides, number of drivers and total fare. Average per driver is also at a reasonable range.

-In Urban cities  total number of rides is less than number of drivers available. Due to abundance of drivers , the average fare per driver is very lower than the average fare per   ride that shows that some urban cities may have high availabilty of service and no demand maybe due to affordability issue for underserved neighborhoods.

The "Total fare by city" chart explains the sum of weekly fare recieved among different city types. There is a peak in demand of service just before march among all the cities as customers move around at the begining of spring.

Urban cities have frequent sharp change in demand of service going from high to low and viceversa at the begining of spring.

Suburban and rural type of cities mostly remain constant with change in demand of service less frequently through January to April.

## Summary
Recommendations for addressing disparities among city types.

1- To increase number of drivers in rural cities to address high demand and low service availability.

2- To decrease number of drivers from urban cities to increase overall  efficiency.

3- To adjust the fare amount in some rural and urban cities to increase affordability for underserved neighborhoods and so to increase the oveall profitability.
